# Get Offline, Nerd – Development Diary

This is the official developer diary for the concept album **Get Offline, Nerd** by *Pen&Poetry*.  
It is not just an album, but a story: every track introduces a persona of the digital age, and in the final song  
**Get Offline, Nerds**, they unite as a clan and decide to log out.

## ⚠️ About this documentation
The songs were created over a period of nine months.  
The core ideas and triggers are authentic, but many details have been reconstructed from memory and creatively  
interpreted for narrative clarity.

This means:
- Timelines may not always match the real process exactly.  
- Some steps have been simplified, merged, or dramatized.  
- Screenshots, notes, and drafts are curated to reflect the *spirit* of creation rather than a 1:1 log.

Think of this repo as an **artbook in Git form**: a behind-the-scenes look into how an album came together –  
with commits, changelogs, and dev-style notes.
